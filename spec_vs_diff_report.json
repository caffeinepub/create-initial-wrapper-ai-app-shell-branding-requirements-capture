  "summary": "All four requirements are implemented in the diff. REQ-1 is addressed by the resolveGroqApiKey() function in useChat.ts that trims whitespace and correctly formats the Authorization header. REQ-2 is addressed by frontend/.env now containing an empty placeholder for VITE_GROQ_API_KEY and the app prioritizing localStorage keys. REQ-3 is addressed by distinct error handling for 401, 429, and network errors in useChat.ts with inline display in AIChatScreen.tsx. REQ-4 is addressed by the ApiKeySetup component in AIChatScreen.tsx validating 'gsk_' prefix and minimum length with inline error messages.",
