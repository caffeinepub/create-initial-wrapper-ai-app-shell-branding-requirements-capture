# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the application name from "Wrapper AI" to "Shake.com" across all visible UI and metadata.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the `<title>` tag and Apple mobile web app meta tag in `index.html` to "Shake.com"
- Update `manifest.json` `name` and `short_name` fields to "Shake.com"
- Replace all visible instances of "Wrapper AI" with "Shake.com" in the UI (sidebar, header, login screen, dashboard headings)

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays "Shake.com" as its name everywhere — browser tab, PWA install label, and throughout the UI — with no remaining references to "Wrapper AI".
